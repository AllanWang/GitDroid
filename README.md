Git meets Android

## Inspiration

There are already many GitHub clients out there.
My goal with GitDroid was to create a design focused, functional, and exemplary app.
Most elements are done internally instead of through libraries, and flows are kept as simple as possible.
With the focus on design, GitDroid takes inspiration from a couple of other projects:

* [FastHub](https://github.com/k0shk0sh/FastHub)
* [OctoDroid](https://github.com/slapperwan/gh4a)
* [Plaid](https://github.com/android/plaid)
